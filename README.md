### Spaceman Basics

* The Spaceman application is used to create, view, modify, analyze and print sections. A section is the basic element of a planogram. Each planogram can have only one section. It is comprised of a backboard, a base and one or more segments. You can also define the notches for shelf brackets and the peg spacing on a section.
* A section is merchandised with Products placed in Positions on the planogram. All products in a section are held in the Product List.
* A planogram may be viewed from several angles, including front, side, top and even cross-sections.
* Positions on a planogram may be viewed using outlines, shapes, units and LIVE images.
* Various types of reports and charts may be created, viewed and printed to help with your analysis.
* You may open planograms that were created in other applications, such as Space Planning and Apollo. You may also save to those formats.
* You may use the Spaceman library to store sections and products. This will allow you to have quick access to these items in any planogram you may have or create.

___

### Spaceman Help

* The Spaceman application allows you to get help in a variety of ways.
* Open the WINDOW menu and choose CONTENTS to open the Spaceman help file. Here, you can get help by topic, content and searching for keywords. You may also click on the HELP tool for this function.
